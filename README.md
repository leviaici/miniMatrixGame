<summary><h2>Homework 6: Mini Matrix Game</h2></summary>
<b>Technical Task -></b>
Small game on the 8x8 matrix. The basic idea of the game is that it generates random walls on the map (50% - 75% of the map) and then you move around with the player and destroy them.

<br><b><h3>Features</h3></b>

<ol><br><b>Dynamic Difficulty:</b> Choose the difficulty level (1 to 3) at the start to control the complexity of the maze.<br></ol>
<ol><b>Randomly Generated Map:</b> The game generates a unique map on the LED matrix for each playthrough, adding variety and challenge.<br></ol>
<ol><b>Joystick Control:</b> Navigate through the maze using a joystick, providing a responsive and intuitive user experience.<br></ol>
<ol><b>Bombs Away!:</b> Deploy bombs by clicking on the physical button to clear walls and make your way through the maze.<br></ol>
<ol><b>EEPROM High Scores:</b> Your best times are saved in the Arduino's EEPROM. If you beat your previous high score, it will be updated.<br></ol>
<ol><b>Customize:</b> Set the brightnesses for LCD or Matrix using Settings Menu. Toggle the sound on/off. All these are saved in EEPROM.<br></ol>
<ol><b>About:</b> Some words about me, the creator.<br></ol>
<ol><b>How To Play:</b> Small tutorial of how to use and play the game.<br></ol>
<ol><b>Live Updates!:</b> Whenever the user is playing the game, live updates will be displayed on the LCD (such like username, number of available bombs and his time).<br></ol>
<ol><b>Game Reset:</b> After completing the maze, press the physical button to reset the game and start a new challenge.<br></ol>

<br><b><h3>How to Use</h3></b>
