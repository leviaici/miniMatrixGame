<b>Technical Task -></b>
Small game on the 8x8 matrix. The basic idea of the game is that it generates random walls on the map (50% - 75% of the map) and then you move around with the player and destroy them.

<br><b>Features</b><br>

<b>Dynamic Difficulty:</b> Choose the difficulty level (1 to 3) at the start to control the complexity of the maze.<br><br>
<b>Randomly Generated Map:</b> The game generates a unique map on the LED matrix for each playthrough, adding variety and challenge.<br><br>
<b>Joystick Control:</b> Navigate through the maze using a joystick, providing a responsive and intuitive user experience.<br><br>
